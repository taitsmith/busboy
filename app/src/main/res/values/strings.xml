        to view your location and have the location setting enabled. If you\'re already at your stop,
        you can find upcoming busses by entering your stop ID (found at the bottom of the sign) and
        pressing the search button.\n\nLong-pressing a \'nearby\' stop will display a map of
        walking directions from your location to the stop, and short-pressing will display a list of
        upcoming busses for that stop. Short pressing a bus prediction will display the current location
        of that bus on a map.\n\nBusboy is currently in a beta testing state, so there are potential bugs.
