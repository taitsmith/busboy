    <string name="dialog_help">You can search for nearby stops if you\'ve granted busboy permission
        to view your location and have the location setting enabled. If you\'re already at your stop,
        you can find upcoming buses by entering your stop ID (found at the bottom of the sign) and
        pressing the search button.
        \n\nNearby:
        \nLong pressing a \'nearby\' stop will display a map of walking directions from your location
        to the stop, and short pressing will display a list of upcoming buses for that stop. By default,
        Busboy shows you all stops within 1000 feet of your location. You can specify any distance
        up to 5000 feet, or select a line from the drop-down menu to see only stops that serve that line.
        \n\nPredictions:
        \nShort pressing a bus prediction will display the current location of that bus on a map. Long
        pressing a prediction will show you detailed information about that bus (its license plate,
        VIN number, seating capacity etc). Clicking the heart button will add that stop to your
        favorites.
        \n\nFavorites:
        \nShort pressing an item on your favorites list will show you upcoming buses for that stop.
        \nLong pressing a favorite will allow you to delete a stop from your favorites.
